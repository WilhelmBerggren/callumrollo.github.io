*(and not matlab)*

In earth sciences, we often do not choose the programming language we work in. Unlike computer sciences, most of us do not get the chance to experiment with multiple programming languages during our undergraduate studies. Instead, the most common reasons for the language used by the typical earth scientist is:

* The language my supervisor uses
* The one language I was taught in undergrad 
* The language our legacy code is written in

For me, the answer to all of these is matlab. I used matlab for my Master's thesis work and still use it for an essential tool of my work, Bastien Queste's `Seaglider Toolbox <http://www.byqueste.com/toolbox.html>`_. Matlab is still a very popular language in oceanography. Several scientists who I respect do excellent work in matlab. It has many tried and tested tools for oceanography. Do why don't I just use it?

My answer to this question centers on a few key failings of matlab. I am by now means the only person to have made this choice. I do not wish to rehash the arguments on the technical deficiences of the language. Instead I will focus on the structural weaknesses of matlab as a tool of science. At the core of this is the insurmountable issue that 

**matlab is not free**.

Why does this matter for oceanography? For one thing, **matlab is not free as in beer**. It is not a trivial cost either, `$275 per year <https://reviews.financesonline.com/p/matlab>`_ for an academic licence in 2020. This is a significant chunk of money for a British academic. For our colleagues in less economically developed nations, it can be an insurmountable obstacle. Much noise is being made on the importance of free access to data and free access to journal articles. But what value are the raw materials of science and the polished end product if the essential processing of that data is inaccessible?

Even if an individual or institution can spare the funding for the licensing (what could your department better do with the thousands it's spending on matlab licences?) **matlab is not free as in freedom**. Even when you purchase a licence, you cannot see the source code of matlab. You cannot know how it works. If mathworks were to fold tomorrow, you have no recourse to. With Python, everything you write can be shared, examined and reproduced. Free software is a critical step to opening science and lowering barriers to entry.
