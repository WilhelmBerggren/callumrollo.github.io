Summary: Some trailcam captures from my back garden in Norwich

### Hedegehogs frequented the garden of my shared house in west Norwich

I noticed that they would run along the low walls of the garden and try to climb them, without succes. So, I installed some hi-tech hedgehog steps (3 bricks and an old plant basket).

These steps rapidly became popular with the local hedgehogs, including some hoglets born that spring.

I have found camera trapping with a motion-detector trailcam to be very rewarding. It is a non-invasive method for monitoring nature and suits people like me who do not have the patience to sit in hides with a telephoto lens for extended periods of time.

Several of the clips have been uploaded to [mammalweb](https://www.mammalweb.org/index.php/en/) for citizen science purposes. At the time of writing, this is the only trailcam site in Norwich.

These videos were edited together (poorly) with the [openshot free video editor](https://www.openshot.org/)
