Summary: My motivations for writing open source software

Recently, a student I was mentoring asked me what I do and why I do it. In the process of responding to this question I was obliged to confront it myself. This post attempts to outline my thinking on the topic.


### What do I do?

At time of writing (summer 2024) I am employed as a "data engineer/oceanographer" at the [Voice of the Ocean foundation](https://voiceoftheocean.org/). When I describe my job to people though, I rarely use any of those words. My work typically consists of:

- Read and act on automated error reports
- SSH into various servers to keep data pipelines and websites working
- Debug CI systems on GitHub
- Manage Issues and Pull Requests
- Contribute to open source projects directly and less directly related to my work
- Give occasional directions to our [fleet of autonomous robots](https://observations.voiceoftheocean.org/)

Basically, I am a programmer (though patio11 would tell me to call myself [anything else](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)). 
Occasionally other more interesting duties come up like going to sea, contributing to scientific papers in a small way and, my personal favourite, teaching and mentoring through projects like [OceanHackWeek](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/) and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).


### Why do I do it?

When I started this job, fresh from my PhD, I had a lot of freedom to define it. There are benefits to being a data department of one person! I decided from the start that I would use and contribute to open source software as much as possible. This was partly an ideological choice. I believe and openness, giving and collaboration for their own sake. When the time came for me to give the traditional final-year PhD student departmental seminar, I used my 40 minutes to promote the use of open source within oceanography, rather than presenting the results on my PhD.

I enjoy a position of great privilege, I have a steady open ended contract (thanks unions!), no pressure to publish and freedom to choose whatever tech stack I want as long as I keep the data flowing and the websites up for the requisite number of 9s. I have used my working hours to improve and expand various Python libraries that our dataflow depends on, like [pyglider](https://github.com/c-proof/pyglider), [ERDDAP](https://github.com/ERDDAP/erddap) and [erddapy](https://github.com/ioos/erddapy). I have also dedicated a lot of time to writing and presenting various tutorials, mostly in the realm of accessing data from and administering, ERDDAP servers (full list [here](https://callumrollo.com/erddaptools.html)).

I am dedicated to the cause of open science. I ensure that everything I write is openly accessible, and where possible I contribute to existing community projects, rather than re-inventing them myself.

### What next?

As a one person data science team, my opportunities for professional growth are limited. I am acutely aware that my technical skills are not developing as they would in a full-time software development job. What improvements I do make are mostly via imitating other people in similar roles, notable the inimitable [ocefpaf](https://github.com/ocefpaf), who's packages, PRs, guides and personal advice have given me some of the most valuable insights of my career. Being a software developer in the 21st century, there are near infinite opportunities to self improve and collaborate across companies, disciplines and borders. It's one of the things I appreciate most about my professions. But it's hard to take advantage of these opportunities. Easy to  become caught in the day to day cycle of error reports, PRs, failing CI and kick long term development down the road. I'm developing technical debt in my codebases and my skills.

One day I will move on to pastures new, but I don't think it will be anytime soon. There are a lot of improvements I can make in my current role. I have a to-do list at least a year long and I'd like to at least train someone else in my role before shipping out. I also really like it here. As to what would cause me to move, I am personally quite invested in Gothenburg, but homesick for the UK too. I often wonder what my life would be like as an oceangoing tech, some of my happiest times have been spent at sea, working 12 hour days as part of a cohesive team. Morally, part of me thinks I should do more to prevent the global catastrophe of climate breakdown. When I am asked in 20 years what I was doing in the last decade when we could have avoided 2 C rise in global temperatures, will I be ashamed of my answer?
