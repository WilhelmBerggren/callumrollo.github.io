Summary: All about me

I work with marine gliders, specifically the integration on Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) onto gliders to directly measure currents in the ocean. The specific glider I work with is SG637 "Omura" equipped with a 1MHz ADCP. Data and live location information from this glider and others in the UEA glider fleet is available on the [UEA glider website](ueaglider.uea.ac.uk/). I am open to collaborations in physical oceanography. Especially projects involving ADCPs on autonomous platforms, shelf break processes and open source science initiatives.

I am an amateur pythonista, leader of [UEA python](https://ueapy.github.io/) and proponent of free software for science. Several of my projects are available on my [github](https://github.com/callumrollo).
