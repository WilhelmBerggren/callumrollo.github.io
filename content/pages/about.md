Summary: All about me

I recently started work as the in-house data scientist at [VOTO](https://voiceoftheocean.org/en). I am responsible for processing, correcting, standardising and distributing scientific data from our fleet of autonomous platforms.

I am a Pythonista and proponent of free software for science. Several of my projects are available on my [github](https://github.com/callumrollo). I have completed collaborative programming projects as part of [OceanHackWeek](https://callumrollo.github.io/hackweek.html) and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). I lead the [UEA scientific python](https://ueapy.github.io/) group during my PhD.

### PhD

During 2017-2021 I completed a PhD at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, UK. I work with marine gliders, specifically the integration on Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) onto gliders to directly measure currents in the ocean. The specific glider I work with was SG637 "Omura" equipped with a 1MHz ADCP.

Data and live location information from this glider, and others in the fleet, is available on the [UEA glider website](https://ueaglider.uea.ac.uk). I rebuilt the website in 2021, based on the original by [Bastien Queste](http://byqueste.com/).
