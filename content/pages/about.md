Summary: All about me

I am a final year PhD student at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, UK. I work with marine gliders, specifically the integration on Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) onto gliders to directly measure currents in the ocean. The specific glider I work with is SG637 "Omura" equipped with a 1MHz ADCP.

Data and live location information from this glider, and others in the fleet, is available on the [UEA glider website](https://ueaglider.uea.ac.uk). I rebuilt the website in 2021, based on the original by [Bastien Queste](http://byqueste.com/) I am open to collaborations in physical oceanography, especially projects involving ADCPs on autonomous platforms, shelf break processes and open source science initiatives.

I am an amateur Pythonista, leader of [UEA python](https://ueapy.github.io/) and proponent of free software for science. Several of my projects are available on my [github](https://github.com/callumrollo). I have completed collaborative programming projects as part of [OceanHackWeek](https://callumrollo.github.io/hackweek.html) and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
