Summary: Registry of interests


In the interests of transparency, inspired by [George Monbiot](https://www.monbiot.com/registry-of-interests/), I publish and update my salary here. Studies indicate that pay transparency is [a key tool](https://www.payscale.com/data/pay-transparency) in [combatting unequal pay](https://www.aauw.org/resources/news/media/press-releases/salary-transparency-linked-to-smaller-gender-pay-gap/). Universities are [not exempt](https://hbr.org/2020/02/can-transparency-laws-fix-the-gender-wage-gap) from the gender pay gap.

I receive the [minimum UKRI PhD stipend](https://www.ukri.org/skills/funding-for-research-training/) of **£15'285** per annum. This is [scholarly income](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim06205) so is not subject to tax.

This income is supplemented by the work I do teaching and assisting in class at UEA. This typically earns me around **£500 - £1'000** per annum.

During January and Febuary 2021, I took a two month break from my PhD. During these months I worked as a technician Grade 6 in the seaglider facility at UEA. I was paid **£13.90 / hour**, equivalent to an annual salary of **~ £30'000**

You can read a short article on the pros and cons of publishing salaries [here](https://time.com/5353848/salary-pay-transparency-work/). The practice is becoming more common, in some countries it is [mandatory](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-40669239). Until that is the case in the UK, I will publish mine here.

I own no property or commercial shares.

I have invested **£6'000** in non-profit bearing  community shares in [The Locks Inn Community Pub Limited](http://www.savethelocks.com/). This is a succesful community takeover of a well loved local pub.
