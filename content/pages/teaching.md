# Python
I have taught several courses in Python at UEA. Most recently the [2020 Cefas/Aries Introduction to Python](https://ueapy.github.io/pythoncourse2020/). This course is taught in cooperation with 2 instructors from Cefas and two from UEA. The course was originally developed by [Denis Sergeev](https://dennissergeev.github.io/) and has evolved over the last [4 iterations](https://github.com/ueapy). This is a comprehensive 3 day course.

I have written my own, shorter Python courses. These are taught in three half day sessions at UEA for post graduate researchers and staff. The materials are available [here](https://github.com/callumrollo/ppd_python) and are designed for self teaching as much as possible. Model solutions to problems are included.

I have given various [code tutorials](https://ueapy.github.io/author/callum-rollo.html) to the UEA Scientific Python group

As of April 2021 I am a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) certified instructor. I taught my first course at NOAA in May 2021.
