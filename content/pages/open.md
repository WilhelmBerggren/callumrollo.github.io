Summary: Open invitation to stay

Hi!

Do you know me? Were we at school together? Are we friends of friends? Did we meet at a party once? Have I merged one of your pull requests?

Come visit anytime. Seriously. I have a flat in Gothenburg, Sweden with a sofa bed and an infinite source of free bread and pastries via [solikyl](https://solikyl.se/). I have camping gear, bikes, paddleboards and various bits of wintersport equipment. The best times to visit Gothenburg are undoubtably May - July and Jan - Feb but you are wecome at any time!

I have hosted family members, former colleagues, old friends, new friends, friends of friends and several touring cyclists from [warmshowers.org](https://www.warmshowers.org/).
